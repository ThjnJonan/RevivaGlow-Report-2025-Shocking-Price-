## What are the ingredients in RevivaGlow

While I don‚Äôt have access to the specific ingredient list for RevivaGlow as it may depend on the exact product within the brand (since there might be different formulas for serums, moisturizers, or masks), here are some common ingredients you‚Äôd likely find in RevivaGlow products based on the brand‚Äôs focus on hydration, radiance, and anti-aging benefits:

‚Ä¢	Hyaluronic Acid :- Deep hydration and moisture retention. It helps plump and smooth the skin by drawing water to the skin's surface.

‚Ä¢	Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) :- Brightening and anti-aging. Vitamin C is known for its ability to lighten dark spots, even skin tone, and reduce the appearance of fine lines by boosting collagen production.

‚Ä¢	Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) :- Improves skin texture, minimizes pores, and reduces redness and inflammation. It also helps to brighten the skin and enhance the skin's natural barrier.

‚Ä¢	Peptides :- Support collagen production, firm the skin, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Peptides help strengthen the skin's structure, improving elasticity and texture.

‚Ä¢	Retinol (Vitamin A) :- Stimulates collagen production, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and accelerates cell turnover. Retinol is a go-to ingredient for improving skin texture and tone over time.
